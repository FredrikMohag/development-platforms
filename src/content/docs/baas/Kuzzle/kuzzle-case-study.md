## Main Features

Kuzzle is a powerful backend solution designed for building scalable and real-time applications. Its main features include:

### Data Storage and Access

Kuzzle provides **real-time data synchronization** capabilities, which is crucial for applications that require instant updates (e.g., social media feeds, live auctions, or chat applications). 

- **WebSockets & HTTP**: Kuzzle supports both WebSockets and HTTP protocols for seamless communication between the backend and client applications. WebSockets are ideal for maintaining persistent connections, ensuring real-time updates, while HTTP is useful for traditional request-response patterns.

- **Realtime Engine & Pub/Sub**: Kuzzle’s Realtime Engine is built on a **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** model, where data is pushed to clients as soon as it's available. Developers can create dedicated communication **channels (rooms)** to which clients can subscribe, and any event in those rooms will trigger real-time updates to the clients subscribed to that room.

- **Custom Event Handling**: The Pub/Sub model allows users to define custom events, letting developers fine-tune how they want to trigger data changes based on specific conditions or user actions.

### Advanced Search

Kuzzle offers highly **customizable search capabilities**, built on top of **Elasticsearch**. This allows developers to execute sophisticated queries on large datasets efficiently.

- **Full-text Search**: Developers can implement complex search features, such as full-text search, to find documents based on keywords, stemming, and fuzzy matching.

- **Geospatial Queries**: Kuzzle enables geospatial queries, allowing developers to search for documents based on their geographical location. This is useful for applications involving maps, location-based services, or geo-aware recommendations.

- **Faceted Search**: You can use filters to refine results based on attributes like categories, dates, or custom tags, enhancing the user experience and making data retrieval more efficient.

### Data Persistence

Kuzzle uses **Elasticsearch** as a NoSQL document storage backend, providing efficient data indexing and retrieval.

- **Indexing and Querying**: With Elasticsearch, documents are indexed by fields, making queries extremely fast even as the dataset grows. Developers can index documents in real-time and perform complex queries to fetch data instantly.

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Kuzzle’s Elasticsearch-based storage allows horizontal scaling, meaning you can add more nodes to handle larger amounts of data as your application grows.

- **Automatic Sharding and Replication**: Elasticsearch automatically handles data sharding (splitting data across different servers) and replication (copying data to multiple nodes), ensuring availability and fault tolerance.

### User Management

Kuzzle’s **built-in user authentication and management** system helps streamline user access and security for applications.

- **Multi-Authentication**: Kuzzle supports various authentication methods, including **password-based**, **OAuth**, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, and more. This flexibility enables developers to choose the right method for their application’s security model.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: With RBAC, developers can define user roles and their permissions. You can create roles such as **admin**, **user**, or custom roles, and assign permissions at different levels (read, write, execute) for different parts of your application.

- **Security Features**: Kuzzle ensures that all user data is protected through encrypted communications (e.g., HTTPS, WebSocket Secure), and sensitive data is stored in a secure manner.

### API Generation

Kuzzle simplifies backend API development by automatically generating **RESTful** and **WebSocket APIs**, providing developers with ready-to-use endpoints for frontend integration.

- **Automatic REST API**: Kuzzle creates **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for data models, meaning developers don't have to manually build APIs from scratch.

- **WebSocket API**: Real-time functionality is integrated directly into the WebSocket API. This is essential for applications requiring live data feeds or instant communication.

- **Custom API Extensions**: Beyond the default APIs, Kuzzle allows you to create custom API extensions to meet specific use cases, giving you flexibility for handling more complex requirements.

### Plugins and Extensibility

Kuzzle is built to be extensible, supporting custom plugins that enhance or change its default behavior.

- **Custom Plugin Development**: Developers can write plugins to add additional functionality, whether it’s for integrating with external services, altering API behavior, or adding specific business logic to Kuzzle’s core services.

- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Kuzzle offers an ecosystem of existing plugins to extend its functionality, such as plugins for **data validation**, **notifications**, **integration with external services**, and more.

- **Event-driven Architecture**: Plugins can hook into specific events within the platform (e.g., data changes, user authentication) to perform actions, such as sending notifications or triggering workflows.

### Cross-Platform

Kuzzle’s flexibility extends to various front-end frameworks and mobile platforms.

- **JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs**: Kuzzle offers **official SDKs** for integrating with popular frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular**. These SDKs allow developers to manage user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and more from the client-side application.

- **Mobile Frameworks**: Kuzzle also supports mobile applications built with **React Native** and **Flutter**. For mobile platforms, Kuzzle’s WebSocket capabilities ensure real-time updates on both iOS and Android.

- **Cross-Platform Synchronization**: By providing WebSocket support, Kuzzle enables seamless data synchronization across devices, whether on a web application, mobile application, or IoT devices, making it a versatile backend solution for any project.

## Use cases

Kuzzle's diverse capabilities make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including

- **Real-Time Web and mobile applications**
   With WebSocket technology, Kuzzle enables real-time applications, such as chat apps, where messages and notifications appear instantly across devices.

- **E Commerce Platforms**:
  Kuzzle’s inventory and stock tracking capabilities make it ideal for e-commerce.
