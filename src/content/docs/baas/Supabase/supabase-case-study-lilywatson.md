## Introduction

Supabase is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) designed to simplify building web and mobile applications. It provides backend services such as authentication, database management, and storage with a real-time API on top of PostgreSQL. Supabase aims to be a Firebase alternative for developers seeking a backend service without vendor lock-in and with SQL capabilities. This report will explore Supabase’s features, market position, and suitability for development projects.

## Brief History

- **March 2020**: Supabase is founded by Paul Copplestone and Ant Wilson.
- **April 2020**: Supabase launches in beta, targeting developers looking for open-source Firebase alternatives.
- **2021**: Supabase grows significantly and joins Y Combinator.
- **2022**: Introduces Edge Functions, expanding its serverless functions capabilities.
- **2023**: Supabase evolves with more community-driven features, such as simplified API integrations and expanded real-time capabilities.

## Main Features

Supabase offers a range of backend services tailored to modern app development, including user authentication, real-time database updates, and media storage. Here’s a breakdown of key features:

- **Authentication**: Built-in user authentication with email and social logins, easy to set up and fully integrated with the PostgreSQL backend.
- **Realtime Database**: Data updates in real time using WebSockets; suitable for collaborative applications where instant updates are required.
- **Storage**: Provides secure storage and retrieval for user-uploaded files, such as images or documents.
- **Database and API Management**: Uses PostgreSQL as a database with instant RESTful API and GraphQL support, letting developers manage their data easily without building custom APIs.
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions that can respond to HTTP requests or database changes, allowing developers to handle complex backend logic close to users.

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication           | Manages sign-ups, logins, and social auth, with customizable rules for access control.       |
| Realtime Database        | Synchronizes updates across users and devices in real-time.                                  |
| Storage                  | Secure, scalable file storage with public/private access controls.                           |
| Database (PostgreSQL)    | Flexible SQL database with built-in API generation and support for real-time queries.        |
| Edge Functions           | Run serverless functions for event handling and custom backend logic.                        |

## Market Comparison

### Firebase vs. Supabase

| Feature             | Supabase                                         | Firebase                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Open Source         | Yes                                              | No                                             |
| Database            | PostgreSQL                                       | Firestore (NoSQL)                              |
| Real-time Updates   | Yes                                              | Yes                                            |
| Authentication      | Yes, built-in                                    | Yes, built-in                                  |
| Storage             | Yes, with access control                         | Yes, but with limitations on file access       |
| Functions           | Edge Functions, SQL-based triggers and actions   | Cloud Functions, JavaScript-based              |
| Community Support   | Large, open-source community                     | Google’s extensive but proprietary ecosystem   |

Supabase’s open-source nature and use of PostgreSQL make it appealing for developers who prefer SQL databases and seek a Firebase alternative without vendor lock-in. Firebase, however, is more mature, with robust documentation and better support for analytics and A/B testing, making it suitable for apps deeply integrated into the Google ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up**: Create a free account on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. **Create a Project**: Start a new project, which automatically provisions a PostgreSQL database.
3. **Set up Authentication**: Configure authentication through Supabase’s UI, setting up email or social logins as needed.
4. **Define Database Schema**: Use the SQL editor to define tables for users, chores, and rewards.
5. **Generate APIs**: Supabase automatically generates RESTful APIs based on the schema.
6. **Integrate with Frontend**: Use the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the backend from your web or mobile app.

Example: To display a chore list, retrieve data using Supabase’s auto-generated API and render it on the frontend with JavaScript or a frontend framework like React.

## Conclusion

Supabase is a powerful BaaS option for developers who prefer SQL databases and open-source software. It is easy to set up, provides comprehensive features (authentication, real-time database, storage, and Edge Functions), and supports rapid development of scalable applications. Its primary use cases include apps needing real-time updates, collaboration features, or secure user authentication without managing complex backend infrastructure. Supabase’s limitations include dependency on PostgreSQL (not suitable for NoSQL needs) and fewer analytics tools compared to Firebase. However, its ongoing growth and active community indicate a promising future, making it a strong choice for projects needing flexibility and control.
