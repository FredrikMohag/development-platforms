This case study examines Userpilot’s features, history, and competitive positioning within the UX monitoring market.

## Main Features

Userpilot provides several core functionalities aimed at optimizing in-app user experiences:

### 4. Feedback Collection

The platform provides tools to collect in-app feedback via surveys and NPS, helping teams make informed, data-driven improvements to the product.

### 5. No-Code Interface for UX Changes
