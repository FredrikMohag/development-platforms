# Decap CMS case study

## Introduction

Decap CMS is an open-source, Git-based content management system (CMS) designed for managing content on static sites. Originally launched as Netlify CMS, it provides a simple yet powerful interface for non-developers to edit and publish content on static sites without needing direct access to the code or a database. Decap uses Gir repositories to store content, this for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing and the ability to update and fetch content directly from Git.

Decap is buildt using [React](https://react.dev/) and acts as a wrapper for the Git workflow, being compatable with [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). It can easily be implemented to projects with independant hosting and backend, or easily implemented to projects hosted by Netlify.

## History

Decap CMS started as Netlify CMS, developed by Netlify to fill the missing role of an open source and community buildt CMS. Decap CMS's vision is aimed to bridge the gap between static site generators and user-friendly content management. In 2023, Netlify CMS rebranded to Decap CMS to show its independacy to the Netlify branding, and take a new role as an universal CMS solution.

## Main Features

Decap CMS is designed with several core features that streamline content management for static sites. At its core, it employs a Git-based storage system, which means all content is saved in a Git repository. A standout feature of Decap CMS is its support for markdown, making content creation accessible to both technical and non-technical users. Markdown enables writers to format text simply and intuitively, allowing them to focus on crafting compelling content without getting bogged down by HTML syntax. Editors can create rich posts with headers, lists, links, and images, making it a powerful tool for blogs, documentation, and other content-rich sites.

Customizable workflows are another significant aspect of Decap CMS. Teams can define specific roles and permissions, tailoring the content management process to their needs. For instance, content editors can draft new entries that require review before publication, ensuring quality control throughout the process. This feature is particularly useful for larger organizations where multiple stakeholders contribute to content creation. Decap CMS is highly extensible, integrating seamlessly with popular static site generators such as Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. This compatibility allows developers to choose the best SSG for their project while still benefiting from Decap CMS's robust features. Furthermore, it supports custom backend setups, making it adaptable to a variety of project requirements.

The user interface is designed to be intuitive, empowering non-technical users to manage and update content confidently. Coupled with real-time previews, editors can see how their changes will appear on the live site before publishing. This feature ensures that formatting is consistent and visually appealing, which is crucial for maintaining a professional presentation.

Lastly, security is also a key focus! ith built-in user authentication and role management features that allow administrators to control access to the CMS. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized changes and protects sensitive content. With extensive documentation and a supportive community, Decap CMS offers the resources necessary for users to effectively manage their static site content.
