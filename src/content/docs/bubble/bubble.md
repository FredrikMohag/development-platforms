## Introduction  
Bubble is a development tool made to handle all aspects of website design, coding, hosting, deployment, and backend API creation without writing a single line of code yourself. Users can create a website using AI prompts, select layouts from a variation of examples or create a website entirely from scratch. Approximately 4.7 million apps have been built on Bubble, amassing a total of 5 billion page views per year. 
## The Idea 
Josh Haas conceptualized the idea of Bubble when he signed up for the website technofounder.com, where entrepreneurs could find computer engineers to help make their idea a reality. Haas realized that there were not enough engineers for everyone who wanted to launch their own tech startup. He then thought that it would be much better if there was a platform available for entrepreneurs where they could build an app or website themselves, without the need for an engineer or for entrepreneurs to sign up for coding classes themselves. Haas quit his job and began building a prototype for Bubble.
## Brief History
__2012:__ Josh Haas meets Emmanuel Straschnov for the first time and shows him the app he had built, which would later become Bubble. Straschnov accepted the offer to create the tool together the very next day.

__December 2012:__ Bubble gets their first customer, who paid $50 a month. 

__2014:__ Bubble gets larger corporations as customers, leading the tool to scale their product and hosting capabilities. 

__2015:__ The two founders post Bubble on Product Hunt, a website where tech-interested people can share any apps, websites, and other tech-related products they have made or discovered themselves. Users can then vote and comment on these submissions. Their post gained traction, and Bubble gained 3,000 new users and 20,000 site visitors in the first week after they made their submission. Before making this post, Bubble had not launched their product publically, and only worked with a handful of clients. 

__2017:__ After steadily growing their team and user base without venture capital funding, the founders hired more computer engineers to work on expanding the features of Bubble. At this point, Bubble had $1 million in annual revenue and 250,000 users. 

__June 2019:__ Bubble reaches out to investors and secures $6.25 million in seed funding from venture capitalist firms SignalFire and Neo, the investors BoxGroup and ThirdKind, and several individual entrepreneurs. This investment was spent on expanding the infrastructure and leaning into more marketing, as Bubble had relied on word of mouth as a marketing tacting since its creation. 

__July 2021:__ Bubble receives $100 million in Series A round led by Insight Partners, a venture capital firm. Betaworks, a venture capital fund, and angel investors also backed the funding. 


## Main Features
- __Everything in one place:__ Bubble offers both front end and back end tools, hosting, domain registration, API building and importing. 
- __Save hiring costs:__ As Bubble is a no-code development tool, little to no coding experience is needed. Therefore, companies can save costs on computer/software engineers and only pay a monthly or yearly fee to create and maintain their web application on Bubble.
- __Scalability:__ Bubble offers several different plans that fit a wide range of users, from individuals on free plans to larger companies requiring higher traffic capacity. Users can pay for additional add-ons so that their site can handle heavier traffic down the line when they want to scale their business to a bigger audience. 
- __AI integration:__ Bubble has implemented AI tools that help users to quickly create their app. Users can provide the AI with a prompt describing what they want to create, and the AI model builds a suitable interface that the user can then customize to fit their needs. 
- __Collaboration:__ Up to 40 members in a team can work together in real time to create their app. 

## Drawbacks 
- __Limitations for building original and intricate designs__: Bubble is geared more towards building with templates or using pre-made UI components. While customization is possible, it is more complicated and companies may need a dedicated development team, which counters Bubbleâ€™s core appeal: that anyone can build a website, even without experience. 

- __No self-hosting:__ Bubble uses Amazon Web Services for hosting, and users that build their apps on Bubble cannot host the site on their owner servers and have to use AWS. While this is not a huge drawback for most companies, some companies that deal with highly sensitive information would need to have physical access to their servers to maintain a high level of security for their users. 

- __Lack of programming languages:__ Users can write their own code in addition to the code that is written for them by Bubble's tools, but you can only use the basic languages of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Users who make more complex apps who need to write in a script language like Python, PHP or Ruby will be limited to using JS and might not be able to achieve their perfect build. 

- __Steep learning curve:__ Bubble has a large library of resources including videos on how to build your app. The company themselves claim that you can learn how to use Bubble in a few days to a few weeks, but the interface may be hard to work in if you are not familiar at all with web development. Users also have to make a workflow intuitive, which is also a hard task to manage for users who have never worked on web development platforms before. Users also need to be familiar with the language of layout and design, like margins, font sizes, and navigation. 

- __No way to export code:__ Users can export code that they have written themselves, but every line of code that is built by using the Bubble drag-and-drop feature is locked behind Bubble's backend. So, if anything were to happen to Bubble, like the company going bankrupt or otherwise shutting down their site, users have no way to export their website to a new hosting platform. This is a huge risk for companies who heavily rely on Bubble's built-in features and companies that do not employ their own development teams. 

## Competitors
Few competitors offer the same product as Bubble. For a complete no-code built web application you need both front end and back end tools, reliable hosting and domain registration, and some users also need to build or import an API. 
These are some of Bubble's competitors that have all or some of the same features as Bubble:
- __FlutterFlow:__ No-code development tool for apps, very similar to Bubble. Created by two former Google engineers. FlutterFlow also has the same pricing as Bubble, but features less resources and has a smaller user base. FlutterFlow also has integrated AI which users can give a prompt, and the AI then builds a suitable app based on that prompt. 
- __WordPress:__ WordPress offers hosting, domain purchasing and the ability for users to build websites using already made themes. WordPress has more plugins than Bubble, but customization is harder to do in WordPress. Since WordPress is a much older technology that has been around for more than 20 years, their site may be more reliable as the chance of WP going out of business is much smaller than Bubble, which is a fairly new and smaller company. However, WP has a steep learning curve and can be harder to use and navigate for people unfamiliar with web development.
- __WeWeb:__ WeWeb is similar to Bubble as it is also a no-code builder. But, WeWeb is only for front end and UI purposes, so you need to build your own back end. WeWeb supports code exportation so you can self-host your site, which is not available on Bubble. 
- __Xano:__ Xano is a lot like WeWeb, but it's for building a no-code back end instead of a front end. Users can create APIs and databases, and also use every programming language and not just JS like Bubble offers. Like Bubble, you can not move your project to your own server, which may be an issue for companies that need to be highly involved and dedicated to customers' security. 

## A Short Guide on How to Use Bubble

1. Create a new user by signing up with a Google account or email.
2. Look through any video content to learn how to use Bubble and read blog posts about the kind of app you want to build to get some tips on how to get started.
3. Start designing your web app. Users can choose to give a prompt to the built-in AI, drag and drop UI components to their work area, or create a site entirely from scratch. 
3. After you are done designing your app, you need to create your own privacy rules depending on what kind of app you have built.
4. Preview and test your app to check for bugs and workflow issues. Show your project to friends or your coworkers if you are working in a team for any input. 
5. Your app is now ready to launch. To launch your app, you need to have a paid plan. The paid plans start at $29 a month for a single user working alone. 

## Conclusion

Bubble can be a great place for a minimal viable project (MVP) to start building their app on, but features restrictions on more complex apps. Bubble was created mainly for smaller start-ups to be able to build their platform without having to hire, manage and pay for a development team, which leads to apps being built both faster and cheaper. Larger companies will take issues with three main drawbacks to using Bubble: it lacks a feature to export the code created by Bubble, that users can not host their own product and rely on Bubble's servers and their security measures, and the fact that customization is limited without the use of several third-party plugins (which can also be a possible security risk). Companies that want to create a stand-out and original app might want to rather employ their own development team to build their app from scratch, as Bubble is created for people with no coding experience. While Bubble has the ability to scale to a company's growing visitor base, companies face challenges in the way that Bubble prices its products. Companies have to pay to access additional server bandwidth, which can become costly for smaller-but-quickly-growing apps. 
The idea behind Bubble is innovative and future-focused, but as it stands now, Bubble is mainly suited for MVPs instead of larger, complete builds. Bubble has received millions in investments during their 12 years in operations, and frequently updates their site with more plugins, ready-made components and an expanding library of resources. As time goes on, Bubble may have features better suited to larger companies with a broader audience, like the ability to program in other languages like Python, giving users the ability to access the complete code of their project, and letting users host their app on their own server where they are in charge of the security instead of relying on Bubble's safety measures.
